# rando

This is my random number array generator API. It's written in pHp and returns an array of numbers based on the caller's criteria.

#current parameters:

        length : number of numbers to generate
        sort   : "asc" or "desc" sorts the array
        min    : minimum number
        max    : maximum number

#4/3/20 added:

        inc    : true or false instead of random numbers, returns numbers incremented from minimum by incBy
        incBy  : number to increment by
